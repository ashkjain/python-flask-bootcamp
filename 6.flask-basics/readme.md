1. We need to create a virual enviornment for our web applications using default 'venv', it is a package manager and it comes with "python". Why we need to create Virtual Enviornment? The reason we should create a virtual enviornment because as we have seen python comes with latest updates and some of the functions and methods are not available to use anymore. To avoid that error in our web application we can create an environmnent with all the dependencies and it will not cause runtime error in future if the base version of python we are using is changed, because we will still be using the version and dependencies that we use to run our program. To create a Virtual Enviornment we use command `python -m venv myenv`. To activate the enviornment use inside the main directory `myenv\Scripts\activate` and install all the packages inside. To deactivate the enviornment use `deactivate`.
